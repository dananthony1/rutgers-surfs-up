## Summary 

In June 75% of temperatures are in the 70's and above, whereas only 50% of temperatures are in this range for December.
These temperate values suggest that the business will have customers year round since the cooler month of December still
have a considerable amount of temperature values in a warmer range.

precipitation to review how business will be affected by the rainy season, and additional queries on the winter
months can be run to determine how many months will see cooler temperatures.
